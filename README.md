Welcome to the keylogger repo! 

Keystroke logging, often referred to as keylogging or keyboard capturing, is the action of recording (logging) the keys struck on a keyboard, typically covertly, so that the person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored. 
Data can then be retrieved by the person operating the logging program.
A keylogger is a program that records your keystrokes, and this program saves them in a log file on your local computer.

Currently, there is one keylogger program for one of the major operating systems; Windows.
