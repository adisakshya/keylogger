# A simple keylogger for Windows

Welcome to the keylogger repo!
Keystroke logging, often referred to as keylogging or keyboard capturing, is the action of recording (logging) the keys struck on a keyboard, typically covertly, so that the person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored. 
Data can then be retrieved by the person operating the logging program.
A keylogger is a program that records your keystrokes, and this program saves them in a log file on your local computer.

Currently, there is one keylogger program for one of the major operating systems; Windows.

## Windows Installation
To change visibility of the window set the `#define` in line 9 to `visible` or `invisible`.

Simply compile into an .exe, and then run. Visual Studio is good for this.

- `invisible` makes the window of the logger disappear, and it also starts up hidden from view. Note that it is still visible in the task manager.
- `visible` is visible, and the window does not close when typing. Great for testing it out.

Both of these save the keystrokes to a .txt file when closed.

> Note that sometimes your compiler may through up errors. If it does, keep compiling - the program still works. As always, please create an issue if you have a problem.

### How to run it?

To run it just type `keylogger` and it'll run:
```
keylogger --log-file keylogger.log 
RECORD extension version 1.13
```

The keylogger is now running! It will log your strokes to the file you
specified. Stop it by hitting the cancel key (grave or \`, if not set with
`--cancel-key`. That's the one under escape on a standard keyboard.)

You can make it run on startup:

`$ sudo make startup`
